# Galactic Alpha

Built during Mercury Retrograde. May Break. Might Moon.

✨ Core Concept:

Galactic Alpha is a celestial-themed DeFi and data tooling terminal where users can visualize on-chain performance through an astrological lens. Backtest token behavior against planetary movements. Stake into high-risk/high-vibe vaults that only activate during specific celestial events (e.g., Full Moon, Mercury Retrograde). Combine analytics, humor, education, and speculative coordination.

Galactic Alpha exists in the liminal space between astrology and on-chain finance. We believe markets are stories, not just signals — and some of the best stories are written in the stars. Our protocol lets users trade that narrative chaos: vaults activate only when Mercury misbehaves, backtests run against lunar phases, and every user walks away with an astrologically-generated ENS identity.

We don't promise profits. We promise vibes.

🌌 Targeted Bounties (3):

Subsquid / SQD Pipes SDK ✔ On-chain price & volume data, piped into our backtesting & vault logic.

ENS ✔ Assign each user a unique astrology-themed ENS subdomain (e.g., venus-warrior.eth).

Zircuit ✔ Deploy vaults as secure, high-yield DeFi strategies on Zircuit testnet.

🛸 Feature Breakdown

Celestial Vaults: Themed staking pools (e.g., Mars Momentum, Venus Yield Trap) with logic tied to live planetary positions.

Backtest Visualizer: Users test correlation of tokens vs astrological events (e.g., SOL during Scorpio moons).

Auto-generated ENS names: New users minted astrology-based subnames tied to their birth chart or favorite coin.

Education Tab: Explains coins as planets (ETH = Sun, SOL = Mars), with poetic DeFi metaphors.

Lunar UI/UX: Vibrant visual design mimicking star maps, glyphs, and tarot cards.

🪀 Demo Path (12 Hour Build)
Hour	Milestone
0-1h	Project structure + README + GitHub scaffold
1-3h	Pipes SDK integration + example price pipe setup
3-5h	Astrology data overlay via mocked or Flare-fetched data
5-7h	Frontend visualizer + vault logic mocked (Zircuit testnet)
7-9h	ENS subname flow integration (random mint)
9-10h	Education & Coin-Planet metaphor UX content
10-12h	Polish, deploy, test, video demo + screenshots
🌌 Vault Examples

Mercury Retrograde Short ETH Vault: Only allows deposits while Mercury is in retrograde. Earns absurd APY but often "breaks" (mimics retrograde delays).

Full Moon Stable Growth Vault: Accepts DAI, activates during full moons. Auto-harvests yield every lunar cycle.

Jupiter Luck Streak Fund: Available during Jupiter transits through fire signs. Uses dice-roll-like logic to rebalance.

🌿 Educational Snippets

"Central banks are Saturn retrograde. They delay growth, constrain energy. ETH is the Sun: radiant but needs anchoring."

"If DeFi had a zodiac, Uniswap would be Gemini (always mirroring), Curve would be Capricorn (structure + slippage fear)."

"Zircuit is the safe haven of onchain orbits: AI guardrails = Saturn's rings."
